# Helpers for MEBS software.

### Present Workflow
1. read .dxf file, extract line coordinates and line segments.
2. find intersection points
3. write point coordinates to .txt file, which used as input for MEBS.

### TODO:
- [ ] Finish functions to generate mesh point data.
- [ ] Auto-meshing function from given geometrical surface of lens, the suggested approach is to represent the grids by Node and Edge.
